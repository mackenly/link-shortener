# Automate Deployments with GitHub Actions
Located in the `.github/workflows` directory, the `deploy.yml` file contains the workflow that is used to deploy Link Shortener to your Cloudflare account. It is configured to run on every push to the `main` branch, and will deploy to the production environment. From your Cloudflare account you'll need to copy the account ID to a GitHub Repository Secret called `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`. You'll also need to create a Cloudflare API Token from your Cloudflare profile with the `Edit Cloudflare Workers` permission template and add it to a GitHub Repository Secret called `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`.

By default the command property uses the demo `wrangler-demo.toml`, you'll probably want to create your own `wrangler.toml` based on the `wrangler.toml.example` file in the root of the Worker's directory. See [getting started](./getting-started) for more information on how to configure Wrangler.

Template for your new `deploy.yml` file:
```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy
        uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
          accountId: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID }}
```
