# Public API Routes

<Callout type="warning" emoji="❕">
    This project relies on Cloudflare's Zero Trust for authenticating requests to the core API routes. This means that core routes will be exposed publically if Zero Trust is not configured. See [Zero Trust Setup](/zero-trust-setup) for more information on how to configure Zero Trust.
