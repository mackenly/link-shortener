# Getting Started
To deploy to your Cloudflare Workers account from within the `./link-shortener` directory, run the following command:
```bash
wrangler deploy
```

## Configuration Options
Set through environment variables, there are several configuration options to make Link Shortener work for your use case.

- `API_KEY` - The API key used to authenticate requests to the public/external API routes.
- `MAX_TTL` - The maximum time to live for a link, in seconds. Defaults to 10 years. Minimum is 60 seconds (exclusive) for any link which is a platform limitation.
- `ROOT_REDIRECT` - The URL to redirect to when the root path is requested. Defaults to `https://mackenly.com`. If left blank, it will redirect to the `/dashboard` page.
- `SLUG_LENGTH` - The length of the slug to generate for each link. Defaults to 6. If being used at scale, you might should consider increasing this, but the good thing is that you can change it at any time and it will still work for existing links.

Example configuration:
```toml
vars = { API_KEY = "super-secure-password", MAX_TTL = "315360000", ROOT_REDIRECT = "https://mackenly.com", SLUG_LENGTH = "6" }
```

## Bindings
The database for this tool is Cloudflare KV which is included in Workers free and paid plan. You can create a KV store with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/get-started/#3-create-a-kv-namespace) or via the [Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/kv/namespaces).

In your `wrangler.toml` file, you can add the following to bind your KV store to the `LINK_SHORTENER` namespace:
```toml
kv_namespaces = [
    { binding = "LINK_SHORTENER", id = "yourkey", preview_id = "yourkey" }
]
```

## Custom Domain
You'll need to edit the route(s) in the `wrangler.toml` file to match your [custom domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains).

Alternatively, you can remove the routes section from your `wrangler.toml` and remove the line that says `workers_dev = false`. This will allow you to use your `project.example.workers.dev` URL.
