## Reporting a Vulnerability

If a vulnerability is identified, please [contact Tricities Media Group](https://tricitiesmediagroup.com/contact) with the message purpose set to "Security." Please provide replication steps and the vulnerability's impact if exploited. If a fix is identified PRs are welcome, but if the severity is reasonably high please attempt to contact us before making public PRs which could endanger users. Thanks!
